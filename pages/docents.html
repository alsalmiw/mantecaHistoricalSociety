                    and learning attractions! We have an urgent need for more volunteer docents for 2019 to help share Manteca’s Museum with visitors by scheduling a few hours a month to open the
                    museum doors, welcome guests and tend to the museum gift shop! You can also help out by keeping things tidy and even volunteering for other committees if you have more time to spare! No prior experience is necessary. You learn as you go as we pair you up with other museum docents. </p>
