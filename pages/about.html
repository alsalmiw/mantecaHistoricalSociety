                <p class="historyParagraph">Early California central valley settlers saw their beginnings centered around farming. Wheat was the main crop in the early days due to a lack of rain in summers. In the early 1900s, Manteca got its start when farmland was inexpensive and new irrigation methods, a railway, and river-system all created promise for growing multiple crops and getting them to market. A farming boom started, with almonds, alfalfa, grapes, pumpkins, walnuts and more. Dairy operations also became reality. Many would begin to prosper with availability of SSJID irrigation water in 1913.</p>

                <p class="historyParagraph">Now, as the areaâ€™s growing farm population created a demand for more services, the village of Manteca began attracting new residents and businesses. By 1918 the town incorporated, and companies, large and small, began to discover Manteca.</p>
