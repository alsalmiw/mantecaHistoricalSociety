                  <p class="card-text">Yokuts tribes populated the San Joaquin Valley from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta south to Bakersfield. They also lived in the adjacent foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, as well as in the foothills of the Coast Range. They were thought to have had one of the highest regional populations in early North America, and shared a common language. Though there was conflict in the Central Valley between Miwok people and new settlers to the area in the early 19th Century, the Museum exhibit is in honor of our Native Californians.
